    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Giovanni Ploner</strong>, a professional passionate about technology, design, and creativity. I enjoy building solutions that blend functionality and aesthetics — whether it’s a digital interface, a website, or a simple idea that makes life easier.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects that helped me grow as both a developer and a designer. I’m constantly exploring new tools and ideas that can make a real impact.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy photography, traveling, and discovering local cultures. Every new experience fuels my inspiration for the next project.</p>
